<h1><b>Multiprogramming OS: A Two-Phase Implementation</b></h1>
<br>
This project was developed in two phases as part of my Operating System coursework. It was completed to fulfill the academic requirements of the subject.
<br>
<b>Phase 1 </b>
<br>
simulates a basic operating system that executes one job at a time without multiprogramming. It handles simple instruction execution, memory operations, and basic I/O using service interrupts.
<br>
<b>Phase 2 </b>
<br>
extends the system by introducing multiprogramming with paging, interrupt handling (TI, PI, SI), and memory management using a page table, providing a more realistic OS simulation.
